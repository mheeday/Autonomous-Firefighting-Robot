# Autonomous-Firefighting-Robot
The developed robot uses L298N motor driver for wheelsâ€™ movement, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect and manoeuvre obstacles, 
KY-026 infrared analogue flame sensor to sense flame, 433-MHz RF module for signal transfer between static and mobile units, 
QMC-5883L magnetometer to aid navigation all been controlled by two Arduino microcontrollers; Uno and Mega.
